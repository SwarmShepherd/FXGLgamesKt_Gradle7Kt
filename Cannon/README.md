# FXGLgamesKt_Gradle7Kt

Each game has been converted and tested.  I believe the Kotlin version is as complete in all games as the Java Version, however, they have not been carefully tested.  

Having both Kotlin and Java source seems to confuse IntelliJ so I have simply removed the Java version for most if not all the games....
